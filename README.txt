# C++ Programming Fundamentals – Pointer & Structure-Based Labs

This repository presents a complete collection of C++ practice programs developed during Programming Fundamentals labs. These exercises focus deeply on understanding how data works at a low level, using pointers, arrays, references, structures, unions, and function-based logic to build strong foundational skills.

## 🚀 What This Repository Covers
This set of programs explores a wide variety of concepts essential for early-stage programmers:

### 🔹 Pointer Manipulation
- Accessing and modifying values through pointers
- Pointer arithmetic and memory addressing
- Passing variables by reference
- Using pointers with arrays and structures

### 🔹 Function-Based Logic
- Swapping values using modular functions
- Computing sums, lengths, and calculations
- Clean separation of logic using reusable functions

### 🔹 Arrays & Strings
- Iterating through arrays using pointer notation
- Displaying fruit names using reference-to-array
- Manually computing string length via pointer traversal

### 🔹 Structures & Unions
- Temperature conversion using struct pointers
- Managing student names, scores, averages, and searching
- Demonstrating memory sharing with a simple union example

## 🎯 Purpose of the Work
These programs were created as part of lab tasks and activities to:
- Strengthen memory understanding in C++
- Build confidence with pointers and references
- Improve problem-solving using small, focused programs
- Reinforce core PF concepts through practical implementation

Everything here is designed to help beginners grasp how C++ actually works behind the scenes, making later topics like OOP and DSA easier to understand.

## 🛠 How To Run
1. Copy any code file into your compiler (Dev-C++, CodeBlocks, VS Code, etc.)
2. Compile using:
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
3. Run:
   ./output
